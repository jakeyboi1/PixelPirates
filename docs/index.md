    title: What is Pixel Pirates?
    details: Hi I am Jake the person behind Pixel Pirates I have 3 years of programming experience with a wide variety of languages. I recently became drawn in by game hacking and have since fallen in love. This site is made as a way for me to mainly recorded my discoveries in an easy to navigate fashion, but also to allow other newbies to learn from my writeups and discoveries! Disclaimer I am very new to game hacking, I am actively learning, I do not claim to be a professional, this site is merely to keep track and share what I have found works for me.

    title: Free Always
    details: I absolutely despise how many of the places that provide good, easy to navigate, and well written content on game hacking almost always have a paywall. This site will always be free, as I think having a place that has quality information in a singlue easy to approach hubs is one of the best resources to learn game hacking.
