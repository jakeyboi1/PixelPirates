# Injecting our Cheat
> So we have made everything we need to make, this will go over actually injecting our cheat!

## Step 1: Preparing our Files
> So when you built each project I told you that it would give you an output directory of where it built your project, and to remember it. This is where we will be using that.
1. Navigate to where our IL2CPP Base project (Step 3's project) built too
2. Inside it should be a file named IL2CPPBase.dll copy it
3. Navigate to where our IL2CPPInjector project (Step 2's project) built too
4. Paste the copied IL2CPPBase.dll into where our IL2CPPInjector project built too

## Step 2: Launch Your Game
1. Launch the game you want to cheat
2. Wait until you are fully loaded into the game and playing

## Step 4: Injecting our Cheat
1. Navigate to where IL2CPPInjector project (Step 2's project) built too
2. In this folder you will see a .exe file named IL2CPPInjector run this file
3. It will then ask you to input the window name of your game in my case the window name is SonsOfTheForest (This will change for each game hover over your games window in your bottom bar to get the window name) input the name and press enter

## Conclusion
> If you did everything right you should now see your FOV spamming like crazy! If not you missed a step or made a mistake
That is all there is to this guide you are now fully equipped to hack any IL2CPP Unity game that exists. I hope you learned a lot, and continue to research this topic. I have had quite a lot of fun researching and learning about this.
