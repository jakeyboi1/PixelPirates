# Introduction to Hacking IL2CPP Unity Games
> Welcome this is the first step in hacking IL2CPP Unity Games.

## What this will cover:
1. This will describe the basic information needed to even begin hacking IL2CPP Unity games.
2. This will include the tools needed to hack IL2CPP Unity Games.
3. This will go over some prerequisites that you must have before starting.

## Basic Information:
### Disclaimers:
1. The information provided in this writeup is solely for educational pruposes.
2. This writeup contains no information for bypassing anti-cheats or preventing detection. I hack offline games, hacking online games ruins peoples enjoyment, and in my opinion is a shitty thing to do.
3. This writeup will only work on Windows, and I can only confirm it on Windows 11, but I assume it works on Windows 10 aswell.

### What is Unity?
1. Unity is a popular game engine. It has made countless popular games notably: Escape From Tarkov, Rust and many more.
2. Unity has 2 methods of compiling your C# code to code the computer can understand.
    - IL2CPP
    - Mono

### What is IL2CPP?
> So we know Unity uses IL2CPP to compile some of its games, but what is IL2CPP?
- IL2CPP stands for Intermediate Language To C++
- It converts in our case C# code to C++ so the computer can understand it
- It allows cross platform support
- Unlike Mono IL2CPP is a AOT (Ahead of Time) compiler only.

### What is DLL injection?
DLL Injection is a method used for runnning code within the address space of another process by forcing it to load a dynamic-link library or DLL.

## Tools Required:
- [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/download) (Yes you will need to download the engine itself, we use files that come with it.)
- [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

## Prerequisites:
> These are things you must have before even attempting to hack IL2CPP Unity games.
- An understanding of programming, and programming principles. This does not have to be with C++ I for example have little experience with these langauges but because I have programmed for years with many languages I can adapt to use them without much difficulty because I know the base concepts of programming.
- A desire to learn. This stuff is very hard, and uses low level knowledge. It will take time to understand.
- Be okay with using AI ChatGPT will be your best friend, for explaining these often hard to find topics. Just do not use it to copy paste use it to actually learn.
